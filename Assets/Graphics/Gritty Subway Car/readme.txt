------------------------------------
Includes textures, materials, and prefabs for Standard, URP, and HDRP renderers.

Model is heavily based on New York City subway cars, but does not correspond exactly to any real-world design.
Model has fully rigged doors, wheel bases, and wheels.
A simple set of animations for the doors opening and closing is included.

A blend shape is included which allows the wheel width to be adjusted for different track gauges.
The default width is sized to approximate the standard gauge in the United States.

A blend shape is also present for an exploded view of the model, originally used for texturing and baking.
It serves no real purpose in-engine, but may be useful if you wish to re-texture the model.

To connect cars together in a straight line, offset each car by exactly 16.75m from the one to which it is connecting.
